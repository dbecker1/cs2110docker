# cs2110docker

This Docker image is used by students enrolled in CS 2110 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. It contains an Ubuntu 18.04 image
that contains the necessary tools for the class (gcc/gdb, complx, vba), along with a VNC server and noVNC to allow students to remotely
access it from their browser. It is currently being piloted before being completely rolled out Spring 2019.

In order to run this image, install Docker and run the cs2110docker.sh script.

Find the Docker Image on Docker Hub at  at https://hub.docker.com/r/dbecker1/cs2110docker/.
